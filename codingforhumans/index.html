        <p>Whether you have an interest to work in web development or are just a curious bystander of the Web, then here is a chance to spread your wings and learn to code a little. In a single day. Even if you've never written or seen a line of code before.</p>
        
        <p>Coding is a means of expression and creativity. It develops mental clarity and logical thought and demystifies the process of creating for the Web.</p>

        <h2>What people are saying</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <p>"Brilliantly informative, fun and useful. This is an ideal course for anyone who wants to learn basic HTML, CSS and Javascript, or anyone who needs a refresher session in any one of these languages."</p>
            <p><em>~ Dan Harris, digital producer at The Times</em></p>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"I was nervous about learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript because I don't think I have a head for programming and have felt out of my depth when trying to teach myself. But this was the friendliest, most welcoming course I could've hoped for: not at all intimidating.</p>
            <p>By the end I really felt I'd achieved something, and not just a basic working knowledge of the three languages, but the beginnings of a proper conceptual understanding of computer programming as a whole."</p>
            <p><em>~ Kate Roberts, user experience designer</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <h2>Who's it for?</h2>
        <p><strong><em>Everybody!</em></strong></p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Perhaps you're <strong><em>a designer</em></strong>, wanting to understand the impact of your designs and speak to clients with confidence.</li>
            
            <li>Or you're <strong><em>a project manager</em></strong>, keen to demystify the tech being used in your products.</li>
            
            <li>Maybe you're <strong><em>the boss</em></strong>, and want to understand how your web developers think or improve the code competency of your team.</li>
            
            <li>Or you're <strong><em>a teacher</em></strong>, aspiring to confidence with <abbr title="Information and computer technology">ICT</abbr> in the classroom.</li>
            
            <li>Or maybe you run your own projects and want to <strong><em>roll your own websites</em></strong></li>
            
            <li>Or you might be taking the very first step of a <strong><em>bold new career</em></strong>…</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Step-by-step</h2>
        <p>By the end of the day, you'll have learned to write the basics of the languages that run every website, page and application on the Web:</p>
        
        <p><strong>HTML</strong> is the language that describes the content on a web page.</p>
        
        <p><strong>CSS</strong> adds styling to the content, such as colours, text size and layout.</p>
        
        <p><strong>JavaScript</strong> is used to make the content interactive.</p>

        <p>This is a beginners' course. Intermediate and advanced sessions are coming soon.</p>
        
        <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
        <p>Confidence with using the Web and using a computer, and access to a laptop that you can bring along (or <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#x74;&#x6f;&#58;codingforhumans&#064;&#076;&#052;&#082;&#080;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;">contact us</a> if you'd like to borrow one).</p>
