        <h2>"Code Up"</h2>
        <h3>Coding for non-coders ~ Tues, 24th July, 2012</h3>
        
        <p>A one day workshop at the <a href="http://l4rp.com">Lab for the Recently Possible</a>, 9am - 5pm.</p>
        
        <p>Coding is a means of expression and creativity. It's a satisfying and potent skill, in an ever-increasingly webbified world.</p>

        <p>Whether you have an interest to work in web development or are just a curious bystander of the Web at work or home, then here is a chance to spread your wings and learn to code a little… In a single day… Even if you've never written or seen a line of code before.</p>

        <h3>Step-by-step</h3>
        <p>By the end of the day, you'll have learned to write the basics of the languages that run every website, page and application on the Web: <strong>HTML</strong> is the language that describes the content on a web page, <strong>CSS</strong> adds styling (e.g. colours, text size and layout) to that content, and <strong>JavaScript</strong> is used to make the content interactive.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This is a beginners' course. Intermediate and advanced sessions are coming soon.</p>
        
        <p>Prerequisites: basic familiarity with using the Web, basic familiarity with using a computer, and access to a laptop that you can bring along (or contact us if you'd like to borrow one).</p>

        <h3>In good hands</h3>
        <p>Hosted by: <a href="http://almostobsolete.net">Tom Parslow</a>, <a href="http://petegoodman.com">Pete Goodman</a> and <a href="http://premasagar.com">Premasagar Rose</a> - all Brighton-based professional web developers and teachers of Web technology.</p>
        
        <h3>Limited tickets</h3>
