            <p><strong><a href="http://www.byobworldwide.com">Bring Your Own Beamer</a> (BYOB) is a one night exhibition for artists and their projectors; a riot of light, colour, sound and movement.</strong> The idea is simple: find a place, invite artists, ask them to bring projectors. There are no limits to the projections: DIY videos, generative art, anything.</p>

            <h3>BYOB Brighton</h3>
            <p>In mid-September, a BYOB night will be held inside the warren of underground tunnels and chorus rooms beneath the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton_Dome">Brighton Dome</a>, as well as the Concert Hall (organised by <a href="http://somewhereto.com">somewhereto_</a> and <a href="http://popupbrighton.com">Pop-up Brighton</a>). In preparation, <a href="/">Lab for the Recently Possible</a> (L4RP) is holding two 'Lab Days' - a chance to get together with other artists and makers to edit video montages, create computer art and let the imagination fly.</p>
            
            <h3>Lab Days</h3>
            <p>These events are free and run from 2pm - 7pm <a href="/#location">at the Lab</a> (pop in at any time). Please sign up to show your interest:</p>

            <h3>What is BYOB?</h3>
            <p><a href="http://www.byobworldwide.com">BYOB</a> is a way of making a huge show with zero budget. It is an exploration of the medium of projection.</p>

            <p>Today, the Web is confined to screens. Tomorrow, information will surround us, composing our surfaces, defining our spaces, enmeshing itself with the ether. A moving image is never an object, and when it is coupled with the increased flexibility of portable projection, the realm of experience quickly expands.</p>

            <p>Projection can mean many things. Projections are very flexible and create a freedom to react to each others works, move things around, and create a dynamic collaborative experience.</p>

            <p>Events are self-organising and have been held in many countries and cities worldwide.</p>
